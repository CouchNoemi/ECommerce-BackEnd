# ECommerce-BackEnd

## description

 I built the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API and used Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
 I created a development database and I seeded with test data
 I enter the command to invoke the application, server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. I can get API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia. I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

 ## Usage
 - To use the back end app download all the files
 - For this application I used the express, mysql12 , sequelize.
-  Before starting to use the application make sure the packages are installed on the app use (nmp i).
-Then create the database with (mysql -u root -p) and paste this
(DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ecommerce_db;)
(CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;) after that (quit).
- Then type (npm run seed) to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes. after that just start the application with (npm start).
